# Pacman-With-GUI
This README provides an overview and instructions for running the Pacman game, which is developed using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts and features a graphical user interface (GUI). The game is designed to run on Visual Studio (VS) IDE.
## Prerequisites
To run the Pacman game on your system, you will need the following:

- Visual Studio IDE (Version X or above)
- C++ compiler
## Setup Instructions
1. Clone or download the Pacman game repository to your local machine.
2. Open Visual Studio and navigate to the project folder.
3. Open the PacmanGame.sln solution file.
4. Build the solution by selecting the appropriate build configuration (e.g., Debug or Release).
5. Once the solution is built successfully, you can run the game.
## Running the Game
1. In Visual Studio, locate the toolbar at the top and find the "Start" button (usually shaped like a play button).

5. The game ends when Pacman either collects all the points or gets caught by a ghost.
## Features
- Graphical user interface (GUI) for an interactive gameplay experience.
- Utilizes Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts to organize code into classes and objects.
